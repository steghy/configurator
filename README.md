# Configurator

Python script for automating some tedious tasks I have to do
every time I install Pop Os on my computer.
The script is divided into 5 parts. Each part describes a
particular task to be performed in macro categories, which are:

1) Solving recurring problems related to connectivity (currently 
   DNS)

2) Preliminary system update.

3) Installation of applications. Download
   packages for customizing some components of the desktop 
   environment (theme, fonts, icons, etc.).

4) Symlinks creation. (they have simplified many tasks).

5) Configuration of different programs (tmux, vim, etc ..)

6) Notify any errors that occurred while running the script
